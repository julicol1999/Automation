# YouTube Video Trends Dashboard - Tableau Project

This repository contains an interactive dashboard developed in Tableau Public to analyze YouTube video trends, designed for marketing planning and decision-making.

##  Project Overview

As a video trends analyst at **Sterling & Draper**, I developed a Tableau dashboard to automate the process of identifying and monitoring trending video categories across different regions. The dashboard provides valuable insights for the advertising team, enabling them to focus marketing efforts on high-impact content.

##  Key Features

- Historical trends of trending videos segmented by **category**, **region**, and **date**.
- Distribution of trending video categories by country.
- Identification of particularly popular categories in the **United States**.
- Comparative analysis of category popularity across regions.
- Interactive filters for **date** and **region** that dynamically update all visualizations.

##  Data Source

The dashboard uses aggregated data from the `trending_by_time` dataset, which includes:

- `record_id`: Primary key  
- `region`: Country or geographic region  
- `trending_date`: Date the video became trending  
- `category_title`: Video category  
- `videos_count`: Number of trending videos  

Data updates occur daily at midnight UTC to ensure up-to-date insights.
